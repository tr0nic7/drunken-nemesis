Bash script that searches a directory for text and pdf files and then search for a keyword in each


Origin

	I had a professor in college that gave us a bunch of pdfs and the tests were all about searching for keywords in them.
	He thought it was going to be hard to find a reference to a specific concept without reading the pdfs first.
	So I made this script for the midterm....

Why

	why not?
